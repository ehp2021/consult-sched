Project description

The app will allow a client to search for a doctor by drug name (i.e. "an oncologist who prescribes Opdivo to >200 new pts a year") or disease specialty (i.e. "a pediatric dermatologist who treats >100 atopic dermatitis pts a month"), and then schedule a consulting appointment with found doctor on the platform.

MVP
