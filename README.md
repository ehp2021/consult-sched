# What is Coda? Project name

Coda is a scheduling tool to search for and booking consults with physicians for financial and corporate clients (i.e. hedge funds and pharma companies).

The app will allow a client to search for a doctor by drug name (i.e. "an oncologist who prescribes Opdivo to >200 new pts a year") or disease specialty (i.e. "a pediatric dermatologist who treats >100 atopic dermatitis pts a month"), and then schedule a consulting appointment with found doctor on the platform.

Users will be able to search for a doctor who can speak on their desired topic and schedule a 30 minute zoom call with them online
